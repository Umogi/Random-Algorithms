# Random Algorithms Repository

This repository contains a collection of random algorithms implemented in C. These algorithms are stored in categorized folders and will continue to grow over time as more are added.

## Folder Structure

- `SHORT/` - Contains various sorting algorithms implemented in C.
  - `SoapWaterSort.c` - A unique sorting algorithm.
  - `DownBubleShort.c` - A variation of the bubble sort algorithm.

More algorithms will be added in the future!

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder and compile the C files:
   ```sh
   gcc SHORT/SoapWaterSort.c -o SoapWaterSort
   ./SoapWaterSort
   ```

   Replace `SoapWaterSort.c` with the desired algorithm file.
